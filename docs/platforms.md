## Supported Platforms ##

CsoundUnity supports building for Windows, macOS, Android 64bit (it has successfully been tested on Oculus Quest) and iOS 64bit.   
WebGL support has been added from version 3.5.0. 
It is still experimental and misses most of the API methods but should be enough to get started. Further API methods will come in later releases.
